# Assembly Resources

This is a repo for help with learning assembly. Listed below are links to different helpful resources.

## Installation

You can try to install nasm on windows using visual studio or some other way, but I found the easiest way to utilize assembly was to ssh into the IUS ada server. If you need more information on this, please feel free to reach out to me.

Alternatively, you could do something like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8UTCqWb2eQ).

## Usage Tips

- Specify your cpu architecture using ```nasm -f elf64 -o <outputfile>.o <asmfile>.asm```

## Youtube Videos

- Channel [New Mind](https://www.youtube.com/c/NewMind) has a helpful [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC7a8fNahjQ8IkiD5f7blIYrro9oeIfJU) that gives very detailed and granular information that is helpful for both understanding assembly as well as operating systems
- This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmxT2pVYo5LB5EzTPZGfFN0c2GDiSXgQe) is specific to nasm and provides more examples (He does run the programs on linux)
